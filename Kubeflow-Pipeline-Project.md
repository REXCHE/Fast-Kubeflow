## LAB / PROJECT: Kubeflow Pipeline (From Scratch) with Custom Docker Images (Decision Tree, Logistic Regression)

This lab/project shows:
- how to create Kubeflow Pipeline with Custom Docker Images

**Steps:**
- Create Python codes and Pipeline Components (Docker Images) for each steps:
  - Download_data.py and Dowload Data Component (Yaml file and docker image with dockerfile that includes dowload_data.py)
  - Decision_tree.py and Decision Tree Component (Yaml file and docker image with dockerfile that includes decision_tree.py)
  - Logistic_regression.py and Logistic Regression Component (Yaml file and docker image with dockerfile that includes logistic_regression.py)
  - Show Results Component
  
### Steps
